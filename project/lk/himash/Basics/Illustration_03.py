#compiler vs interpreter------------------------------------
#compiler responseble for if there any language of code its convert
#into machine understanded language. for example C, C++, Go those are compiler
#based languages which means its only use compiler. compiler generate file
#its .exe(execute) format.compile based language speed than interpreted
#based language because interpreted language need all the time recompile
#all source code line by line.
#interpreter responsible for read the line by line of source code and display
#the result browser or somewhere else. for example JS is interpreter based
#language. interpreter doesnt make seprate file for source code file.

#Some language use both compiler and interpreter such as Java,Python. Its called
#Hybrid languages.Compiler converts source code into byte code. in this time
#compiler check errors as well and after its convert into machine code
#using interpreter. for interprete Java using JVM like JS use for browser.
#This languages includes portability which means its byte code able to run
#any OS but only compiled code unable to run every OS.only compiled code run
#able to specific OS.When java compile the file its create a .class file
#for source code file and python_roadmap doesnt.its can see executing this command.
#python_roadmap -m py_compile [file.py]
#then able to see __pychache__ file and its include a byte code file.
